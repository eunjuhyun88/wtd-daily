/**
 * HumanDecisionAgent — replays human decisions recorded in the trajectory
 * store. Not a "learned" policy in any sense; it is a trajectory-indexed
 * lookup that lets us compare any candidate policy against what real users
 * actually did on the exact same verdict blocks.
 *
 * Why it's the hardest baseline to beat:
 *   Humans see information outside the VerdictBlock — screen context, prior
 *   decisions in adjacent tabs, intuitions the engine never encoded. A
 *   learned agent beating this baseline with statistically significant
 *   margin is the strongest possible result in this project. A learned
 *   agent tying or losing to it is still publishable — just honest about
 *   where the ceiling is.
 *
 * Policy sketch (to be implemented when trajectory store reader lands):
 *   1. Look up `DecisionTrajectory` rows indexed by `verdict.trace_id`
 *   2. Filter to rows where `decision.actor.kind === 'user'`
 *   3. Return the recorded (action, size_pct, leverage, stop, tp, note) as
 *      an `AgentDecisionProposal`
 *   4. In strict mode, throw when no matching human decision exists; the
 *      harness must filter the slice down to human-covered trajectories
 *      before running this agent so coverage gaps do not silently
 *      disqualify folds
 *
 * Deterministic: the same `trace_id` always maps to the same recorded
 * decision. Replaying the same slice twice produces identical metrics.
 *
 * Reference:
 *   `research/thesis/current-thesis.md`
